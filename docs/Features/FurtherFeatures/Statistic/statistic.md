## Further Features: statistic view

There is a statistic view to keep an overview on all existing [TrackLog Objects](../../track.md).

To enter the statistic view use <span style="color:gray">*Menu | Statistic*</span>.
The following figure shows an example of the statistic view: 

<img src="./stat1.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
<img src="./stat2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;

Each statistic entry consists of three lines - details are explained here:

<img src="./stat3.png" width="800" />&nbsp;
