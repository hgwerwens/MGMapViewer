## Further Features: enlarge temporary a view value
 
This feature allows to enlarge temporary a value of a dashboard entry or a status line entry.
In both cases just tap on the entry and this entry value will be visible for 1.5s
in a central view on the Screen.

So what is this feature good for? If you have perfect eyes, then for nothing. If you are 
on a mountain bike tour without reading glasses, then it's really valuable.

The following figures illustrate this - press on the length value and it will be enlarged.

<img src="./eln0.png" width="300" />&nbsp;
<img src="./eln1.png" width="300" />&nbsp;

Similar press on the height gain value and it will be enlarged too.

<img src="./eln2.png" width="300" />&nbsp;
<img src="./eln3.png" width="300" />&nbsp;

But this work also for the status line, e.g. for the time:

<img src="./eln4.png" width="300" />&nbsp;
<img src="./eln5.png" width="300" />&nbsp;
