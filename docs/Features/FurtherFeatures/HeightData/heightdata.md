## Further Features: height data

This app is able to handle offline hight data from ".hgt" files in various situations. These .hgt based height data will be added to all points. 
Especially they are useful in case of route planning, since you get immediately in idea about the height meters of the route and as well they are the 
basis for the visualisation of the [height profile](../HeightProfile/hprof.md).

These ".hgt" files can be downloaded form the <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/">SRTMGL1</a> project. This project provides height
data with a raster of 1 arc second, which is roughly 30m. For more details see the project page.

If you want to download these ".hgt" data, you need to register via "https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home".
Once you are registered and logged in, you can select in your profile the menu item
<span style="color:gray">*Application/Authorized Apps*</span> and you will find an entry <span style="color:gray">LP DAAC Data Pool</span>.  

Now you can download with the link
