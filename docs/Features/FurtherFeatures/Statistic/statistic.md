## Further Features: statistic view

There is a statistic view to keep an overview on all existing tracks.

To enter the statistic view use <span style="color:gray">*Menu | Statistic*</span>.

<img src="./stat1.png" width="200" />&nbsp;

The following figure shows an example of the statistic view - for the coloring see [here](../../track.md).
Inside of a color group the entries are sorted (descending) by name.

Each statistic entry consists of three lines - details are explained here:

<img src="./stat3.png" width="800" />&nbsp;

Wit a long press on an statistic entry you get a popup menu:

<img src="./popup.png" width="400" />&nbsp;

This menu offers functionality:
- Height Profile: open the height profile for this track
- Select Track: open this track as the selected track
- Share Track: open a share intent - allows to send the track as gpx file via mail, Whatsapp, etc
- Delete track: delete the track (there is a confirm required - but once it is deleted, you don't get it back!)
