## Main Track Feature: search track(s) by marking a bounding box 

This feature means search all tracks that go through a previously marked rectangular area, also called bounding box.

The first step for the usage is to mark a rectangular area. To do this select the Menu | BoundingBox | New.

<img src="./MarkBox1.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
<img src="./MarkBox2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;

Now there are two Options to do the marking:
- first tap to the upper left corner and then to the lower right corner (this option is shown below)
- Make a drag action from the upper left corner to the lower right one

<img src="./Box1.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
<img src="./Box2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;

Both points (upper left and lower right) can be adjusted with drag and drop actions.

Now use the Menu | BoundingBox | Load

<img src="./LoadBox1.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
<img src="./LoadBox2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;

As the result all tracks passing through the marked bounding box will be loaded to the set of available tracks.
In the example there are two tracks loaded. Tap on one track to make it the selected track. Tap on the other
track to make it the selected track instead. 

<img src="./LoadedBox2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
<img src="./LoadedBox3.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
<img src="./LoadedBox4.png" width="400" />&nbsp;
 
With Menu | BoundingBox | Hide the bounding box will disappear.
