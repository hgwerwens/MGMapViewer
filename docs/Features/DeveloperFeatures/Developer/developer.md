## Developer Features: developer documentation

This is in fact not a feature of the software, this is rather the entry point for more developer documentation.

It consists of:
- the [view model](./ViewModel.md)
- the [main class model](./MainClassModel.md) of the app
- the [data model](./Model.md) for tracks (the model part form the Model-View-Control architecture for tracks
- the [graph model](./graph.md) as the basis for the route calculation

The UML class models are created with Visual Paradigm Community Edition. 
The project file of the model is available [here](../../../more/mgmap.vpp).

The view model is created with Libre Office, the source file is available [here](../../../more/ViewModel.odg).  

The JavaDoc of the source code is available [here](../../../javadoc/index.html)
or via [github pages](https://mg4gh.github.io/MGMapViewer/javadoc/index.html).
