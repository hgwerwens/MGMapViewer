## Developer Features: Preferences 

**Caution:** use this feature only, if you exactly know what you do!

There is an option to set manually shared preferences values. Create in the config folder a subfolder load containing files with the extension 
".properties" which contain key value pairs. By default these preferences are considered as String preferences. Using the prefix "Boolean:" in the 
value is changing this behaviour to a Boolean preference.


### Location based search

If you use the playstore version and you want to use full search functionality, you need to set

```
FSSearch.reverseSearchOn=Boolean:true
FSSearch.locationBasedSearchOn=Boolean:true
```
From the device you can use this link create this configuration: 
[geocode.zip](mgmap-install://mg4gh.github.io/MGMapViewer/Features/FurtherFeatures/Geocode/geocode.zip)

### Routing algorithm

You can configure three different routing algorithms:
- [AStar](mgmap-install://mg4gh.github.io/MGMapViewer/Features/MainTrackFeatures/Routing/routing_astar.zip)
- [BidirectionalAStar](mgmap-install://mg4gh.github.io/MGMapViewer/Features/MainTrackFeatures/Routing/routing_bidirectionalastar.zip) (AStar with search in both directions, delivers optimal result)
- [BidirectionalAStarFNO](mgmap-install://mg4gh.github.io/MGMapViewer/Features/MainTrackFeatures/Routing/routing_bidirectionalastarfno.zip) (AStar with search in both directions, faster, but may deliver none optimal result)

For BidirectionalAStar it looks like this:
```
#FSRouting.RoutingAlgorithm=AStar
FSRouting.RoutingAlgorithm=BidirectionalAStar
#FSRouting.RoutingAlgorithm=BidirectionalAStarFNO
```

### Direct Map Download

The download of [mapsforge vector maps](../../MainMapFeatures/Mapsforge/mapsforge.md) is done via the [openandromaps](https://www.openandromaps.org/) site. 
Since this page was recently down and because the location of the maps is in fact an ftp server:
```
https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap
```
there is an option download directly from the ftp server.
For this purpose you can use the preference:
```
DownloadMapsDirect=Boolean:true
```


### Load tiles for transparent layers

When you use tile stores and also the hgt layer, then you can use the bounding box to load further tiles/hgt files. 
If there is more than one layer that mght be the target of such an operation, you will get a dialog to select the 
layer on which the operation (load remaining, load all or delete all) shall be executed. 
The standard behaviour is to offer all Tilestore and HgtGridLayers, except these layers are fully transparent at that point of time.
With the property
```
FSBB.loadTransparent=Boolean:true
```
you will get also transparent layers offered for the operation.

### Sample config

The following sample configuration
```
#FSRouting.RoutingAlgorithm=BidirectionalAStarFNO
FSRouting.RoutingAlgorithm=BidirectionalAStar
FSSearch.reverseSearchOn=Boolean:true
FSSearch.locationBasedSearchOn=Boolean:true
DownloadMapsDirect=Boolean:false
```
can be downloaded and installed [here](mgmap-install://mg4gh.github.io/MGMapViewer/Features/DeveloperFeatures/Preferences/config.zip).
After installation you can use the internal [FileManager](../../FurtherFeatures/FileManager/filemanager.md) to modify these preferences.
