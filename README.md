# MGMapViewer
This app is mainly intended for biking and hiking. It is based on the [mapsforge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge) library available via github.

## Plan - Record - View - Share
Based on the great offline maps from (e.g. from [openandromaps](https://www.openandromaps.org/)) you can plan, record, view and share
your tracks ... and much more.
