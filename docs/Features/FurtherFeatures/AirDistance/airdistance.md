## Further Features: air distnace

If you have switched on GPS directly or via track recording, then you can determine the 
air distance from your position to a point of interest.

Just move the center of the map (marked with a small black circle) to this point of interest.
There will be a thin line between your position an the center position. The air distance will be 
shown in the status line.
