## Further Features: center automatically current gps position

By default this feature is switched on. This means that for every new GPS 
position the map will be aligned in a way that the new position is in the center
of the map.

The following sequence shows the alignment of the map with each newly detected position:

<img src="./center1.png" width="200" />&nbsp;
<img src="./center2.png" width="200" />&nbsp;
<img src="./center3.png" width="200" />&nbsp;
<img src="./center4.png" width="200" />&nbsp;

This is a usually a nice feature since it's not necessary to align the map 
manually to the current position. But if you want to check some other area
e.g. to verify the route, it might be annoying if you scroll to a certain position
and then the app jumps back due to a new location from GPS sensor. Therefore this
feature allows to disable/enable this function to automatically center GPS position.

Use <img src="../../../icons/group_record2.svg" width="24"/> + <img src="../../../icons/center1.svg" width="24"/> to switch the feature off.

If you move further, then the screen isn't anymore aligned to new GPS locations

<img src="./center5.png" width="200" />&nbsp;
<img src="./center6.png" width="200" />&nbsp;

As soon as you switch the feature again on
(<img src="../../../icons/group_record2.svg" width="24"/> + <img src="../../../icons/center2.svg" width="24"/>), the screen will be aligned
to the last GPS position.
