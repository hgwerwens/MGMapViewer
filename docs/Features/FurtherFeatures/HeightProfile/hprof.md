## Further Features: height profile

To enter the statistic view use <span style="color:gray">*Menu | Height Profile*</span>.
The following figure shows an example of the height profile view: 

<img src="./hprof1.png" width="400" />&nbsp;<img src="./hprof2.png" width="400" />&nbsp;

As it is visible in the example, the height profile can visualize multiple tracks at the same time.
For coloring please check the [track definitions](../../track.md). 

As the example shows with the red and the purple line, it's easy to check your position on a route. Same 
thing is possible with the selected track.
