## Further Features: toggle gps

Beside the option to record a track, it is also possible to "just" switch on the GPS 
function. This can be done with
<img src="../../../icons/group_record1.svg" width="24"/> + <img src="../../../icons/gps1.svg" width="24"/>.

The red circle has a fixed size with the center on the actual position.
The blue circle reflects the accuracy of the given gps measurement in meter. 
Therefore the size of the circle is changing with zooming as we can see in the second figure:

<img src="./gps2.png" width="300" />&nbsp;<img src="./gps3.png" width="300" />&nbsp;

After the usage switch off this function with
<img src="../../../icons/group_record2.svg" width="24"/> + <img src="../../../icons/gps2.svg" width="24"/>.


**Note**: As long as the GPS is switched on there is a Notification active. It disappears after switching the GPS off.
