## Main map Feature: mapsforge

Typically you will download mapsforge compliant maps from [openandromaps](https://www.openandromaps.org/). 
But you can create these maps also with the software from the [mapsforge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge) library.

A mapsforge map is a ".map" file. This file has to be placed in the directory "MGMapViewer/maps/mapsforge/"

Here is an example of such a map: 

<img src="./mapsforge_map.png" width="400" />

As shown already in the  [Getting Started](../../../GettingStarted/GettingStarted.md) you can use the mechanisms via
<img src="../../../icons/group_task.svg" width="24"/> + <img src="../../../icons/download.svg" width="24"/>
to download the map you want.
