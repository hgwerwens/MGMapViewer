<p>This package contains the software for the feature: "<b>gra</b>phical <b>d</b>etails (grad)".
    This is rather a developer feature for the routing feature. It allows to visualize the complete graph as it is part of one tile in the MapDataStore.
    Additionally it highlights the closest way of the data store with all it's points. These information are helpful to verify, if the routing doesn't
    provide the expected path.
